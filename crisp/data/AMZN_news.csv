During a pre-recorded internal Q&A session earlier this month, Jassy told employees it was “past the time to disagree and commit” with the policy, which requires corporate employees to be in the office three days a week.  The phrase “disagree and commit” is one of Amazon’s leadership principles, and was used often by the company’s founder and current executive chairman, Jeff Bezos.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9afa41f8e5ec6ce9af99275626cf227af70f46dee22eb6d9059b0c310487fc0a

2023-08-29 16:40:07,Hollywood strikes could have $5B+ impact on economy: Strategist,Yahoo,"Movies such as Dune: Part Two, Challengers, and White Bird are seeing their releases delayed due to the ongoing strikes in Hollywood. Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden estimates that the economy will take a $5 billion plus hit from the ongoing strikes. Klowden joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his findings. Klowden says, ""the main thing we’re really factoring into it, is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we’re really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but were feeling anywhere that filming is talking place across the country and in all the industries and all the small business and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible."" Major companies like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN), are ""all getting affected, but we don’t see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures,"" Klowden says. Klowden explains that these companies are able to ""put off costs right now, but ""the catch is"" with these delayed movie releases, ""their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.""",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=86e5c718a7671d9865ed7fe44a96e78a9ac82fb90f7f717b740b28d46b4c97ae

""If this AI moment ends up being half as good as the hype currently says that it might become, I don't think we'll be able to get away from generative AI,"" Wilhelm says.
