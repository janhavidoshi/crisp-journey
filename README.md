# Real-Time Financial News Analysis and Market Trend Prediction

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a system that analyzes real-time financial news and predicts market trends. The system will use a large language model to perform sentiment analysis on financial news articles and a basic machine learning model to predict the stock price's future direction, either 'bullish or bearish.

## Data Sources
- Historical stock price data: This data will be collected from https://finnhub.io/.
- Financial news articles: These will be collected from https://finnhub.io/.
